## SQL Commands

The SQL commands provided in the document include:

- CREATE TABLE commands for creating the database schema
- INSERT INTO commands for populating the tables with sample data

These commands can be executed in a SQL database management system to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new database in your SQL database management system.
2. Execute the CREATE TABLE commands to create the necessary tables.
3. Execute the INSERT INTO commands to populate the tables with sample data.

Once the tables are created and populated, you can perform various SQL queries and operations on the data to manage the airport system.
